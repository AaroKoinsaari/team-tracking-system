# JavaScript Orienteering Team Management Project

## Project Description
This JavaScript project, developed as part of a Web Development course at the University of Jyv채skyl채, focuses on managing orienteering events. The base database and XML structure were provided as starting points, while the implementation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was independently carried out. The JavaScript portion includes some pre-built helper functions to enhance functionality. The project offers an intuitive interface for efficient team and category management, making it an ideal learning tool for practical event management scenarios. Additionally, it serves as a practical exercise, especially in handling forms on a website.

## Features
- Team management: Add, edit, and remove teams.
- Category handling: Organize events into different categories.
